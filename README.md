# Features Demo M2M Client

This application works with the `FeaturesDemo` project that you can find in this organization.

This project is completely empty at DesignTime, pages and variables are synchronized from the `FeaturesDemo` runtime via OPC/UA. To run this application you may need to configure proper IP addresses in the OPC/UA client settings of the project so it can connect to the `FeaturesDemo` runtime if not running on the same machine.
